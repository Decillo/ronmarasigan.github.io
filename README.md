# LavaLust Framework Documentation

## Server Requirements
	* At least use PHP 7.2
	* MySQL 5 or higher
	* PDO is installed
	* mod_rewrite is enabled

## LavaLust is installed in four steps:
	1. Unzip the package or you can also clone its repository in Github
	2. Upload the LavaLust folders and files to your server.
	3. Open the application/config/config.php file with a text editor and set your base URL.
	4. If you intend to use a database, open the application/config/database.php file with a text editor and set your database settings..

	If you wish to increase security by hiding the location of your LavaLust files you can rename the system and application folders to something more private. If you do rename them, you must open your main index.php file and set the $system_path and $application_folder variables at the top of the file with the new name youâ€™ve chosen
